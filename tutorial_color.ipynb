The diagonal elements, which represent the similarity of the same items, are by definition always zero, so they are excluded.

        "Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT) is a technique used to identify correspondences between two sets of points (referred to as \"structures\") and to quantify the degree of similarity between these structures. In the case of the 93 color similarity structure, there are 93 points in each point cloud, where each point represents a color. GWOT attempts to find the optimal transportation plan between these point clouds using only the internal relational information of each structure. The figure above, generated by Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), illustrates the color similarity relationships as point clouds for both Group 1 and Group 2 participants. The purpose of using GWOT is to determine which points (which colors) in Group 1 should be transported to which points (which colors) in Group 2. The amount of mass transported represents the degree of correspondence (or the probability of correspondence) between the points in Group 1 and Group 2. Note that the transportation is generally many-to-many, rather than one-to-one. The degree of similarity between the two structures is then quantified by the minimized transportation cost, known as the Gromov-Wasserstein distance."

Visualizing the actual optimal transportation matrix shows that the diagonal elements are indeed large.
